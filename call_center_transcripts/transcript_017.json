  "call_transcript": "Agent: Thank you for calling SecureCard Customer Service, this is Samantha. How can I help you today?\n\nCustomer: Hi Samantha, I'm calling about an overlimit fee that was charged to my account. I think there's been a mistake because I've been very careful about staying under my credit limit.\n\nAgent: I'll be happy to help you review that overlimit fee, Alan. Let me look into this for you. Can you verify your account with your full name and the last four digits of your card?\n\nCustomer: Alan Foster, 3456. I've been tracking my spending carefully and I know I didn't go over my limit.\n\nAgent: Thank you. And can you confirm your zip code?\n\nCustomer: 75025.\n\nAgent: Perfect, I have your Basic account here with a $2,500 credit limit. I can see there was an overlimit fee of $35 charged on September 1st. Let me look at your account activity around that time to understand what happened.\n\nCustomer: I check my balance almost daily through the app, and I was nowhere near my limit.\n\nAgent: I understand your confusion, Alan. Let me trace through the transactions... I can see that on August 30th, your balance was $2,247. Then on August 31st, there was a charge for $289.50 at 'AutoRepair Plus' which brought your balance to $2,536.50, putting you $36.50 over your limit.\n\nCustomer: Wait, that doesn't make sense. I never authorized any auto repair. I do my own car maintenance, and I definitely didn't spend almost $300 at any auto shop.\n\nAgent: That's concerning, Alan. Let me get more details about this transaction... The charge from AutoRepair Plus was processed as a card-present transaction on August 31st at 2:17 PM in Dallas, Texas. Do you recall being in Dallas that day?\n\nCustomer: I live in Dallas, but I definitely wasn't at any auto repair shop. This sounds like fraud. But why wasn't I contacted about going over my limit?\n\nAgent: That's a great question. Let me check your contact preferences... I see we have your phone number and email address. We should have sent you an alert when you went overlimit, but I'm not seeing that an alert was successfully delivered.\n\nCustomer: I never got any notification at all. And if this is a fraudulent charge, then the overlimit fee shouldn't be my responsibility either.\n\nAgent: You're absolutely right, Alan. If this is indeed a fraudulent transaction, then the overlimit situation was not your fault. Let me start a fraud investigation on this AutoRepair Plus charge right away.\n\nCustomer: Good. How long will that take?\n\nAgent: The fraud investigation typically takes 5-10 business days for an initial determination. However, I can provide you with a provisional credit for the $289.50 charge immediately, which will bring your balance back under your limit.\n\nCustomer: What about the overlimit fee?\n\nAgent: That's where I need to be honest with you, Alan. While I can reverse the fraudulent charge immediately, the overlimit fee reversal requires approval from our Overlimit Fee Review department, since it's tied to the fraud claim.\n\nCustomer: That seems ridiculous. If you're admitting the charge is fraud, why can't you reverse the fee that was caused by the fraud?\n\nAgent: I completely understand your frustration, and you're logically correct. Unfortunately, our system requires the fraud investigation to be completed before overlimit fees caused by fraud can be automatically reversed. It's a policy issue that many customers find frustrating.\n\nCustomer: So what are my options?\n\nAgent: I can escalate this to a supervisor who might have more authority to reverse the overlimit fee immediately. I can also make sure your case is marked as high priority so it gets resolved quickly.\n\nCustomer: Yes, I want to speak to a supervisor. This is unacceptable.\n\nAgent: I completely understand. Let me get a supervisor on the line for you. Before I do, I'm going to process the provisional credit for the fraudulent charge, so at least your balance is back to normal.\n\n[Transfer to supervisor]\n\nSupervisor: Hello Alan, this is Supervisor Mark Wilson. Samantha has briefed me on your situation, and I apologize for the frustration this has caused.\n\nCustomer: Mark, this is a simple situation. Someone used my card fraudulently, it put me over my limit, and I got charged a fee. The fee should be reversed immediately.\n\nSupervisor: I agree with your logic completely, Alan. Let me see what I can do... I'm reviewing the transaction, and this does appear to be a clear case of fraud. The merchant category and location don't match your typical spending patterns at all.\n\nCustomer: Exactly. So can you reverse the overlimit fee?\n\nSupervisor: I'm going to make an exception and reverse the $35 overlimit fee right now. Normally we wait for the fraud investigation to complete, but this case is straightforward enough that I'm comfortable making this decision.\n\nCustomer: Finally! Thank you.\n\nSupervisor: However, I do need to let you know that if the fraud investigation somehow determines this was not fraud - which I consider very unlikely - the overlimit fee could be re-applied.\n\nCustomer: That won't happen because I didn't make this charge. But I appreciate you being upfront about the policy.\n\nSupervisor: I'm also going to have our IT team investigate why you didn't receive the overlimit alert. That's a service failure on our part.\n\nCustomer: Good, because I could have addressed this immediately if I had known.\n\nSupervisor: Exactly. You should always be notified when you approach or exceed your credit limit. I'm also adding a $25 statement credit as an apology for the notification failure and the inconvenience this has caused.\n\nCustomer: I appreciate that, Mark. When will I know the final result of the fraud investigation?\n\nSupervisor: You'll receive an email update within 5-7 business days with the final determination. But based on what I'm seeing, I'm confident this will be resolved in your favor.\n\nCustomer: And if I have problems with the overlimit alerts in the future?\n\nSupervisor: I'm adding a note to your account about this issue. If you ever don't receive expected alerts, just mention this case and any agent can see the history and help immediately.\n\nCustomer: Mark, thank you for taking care of this properly. Samantha was helpful but didn't have the authority to fix the real problem.\n\nSupervisor: Samantha did everything she could within her authority, and I'm glad we could get this resolved for you today. Is there anything else I can help you with?\n\nCustomer: I think that covers everything. I just hope the fraud investigation goes smoothly.\n\nSupervisor: It should. We'll keep you updated every step of the way. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, and again, I apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nCustomer: Thank you, Mark. Have a good day.\n\nSupervisor: You too, Alan. Goodbye!",
